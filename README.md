Ignore the chatmd and other package files please!!

This ia my rendition of how discord looks like, completely frontend.
Backend is completely handled by firebase and my file management is horrible so i apologize about that.

Capable of adding and deleting servers, and sending messages in them, channel implications coming soon! Maybe even adding friends?
